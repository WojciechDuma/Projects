            <h1 id="title">Marcus Aurelius</h1>
            <p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus (26 April 121 - 17 March 180) - Roman emperor from 161 to 180 and a
                Stoic philosopher. He was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good Emperors, and the last emperor
                of the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace and stability for the Roman Empire. He served as Roman
                consul in 140, 145, and 161.</p>
            <p>He has long been respected as embodying the Platonic concept of the Philosopher King as articulated in
                Plato’s Republic: a ruler who does not seek power for his own sake but to help his people. He was
                introduced to philosophy at a young age and his Meditations, composed while on campaign in his fifties,
                make clear that he held a deeply philosophical, specifically Stoic, view throughout his life. </p>
            <p>He lived his philosophy in both his private and public life in that he consistently placed the needs of
                the people before his own desires or visions of glory and worked for the common good. Even so, he
                successfully conducted campaigns in Germania and managed the affairs of the empire efficiently. He died
                of natural causes following an illness in 180 CE and was instantly deified.</p>

            <h2>Meditations</h2>

            <p>Aurelius’ Meditations is his true legacy to the world, far out-stripping any achievements of his reign,
                however notable they may have been.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Meditations is far from a philosophical treatise, however; it is one man’s thoughts on life and the
                struggle to remain at peace with one’s self in a world which constantly threatens such peace. Aurelius’
                answer to the problem is not an answer but a course of discipline in denying one’s self the luxury of
                self-pity. In accordance with the Stoic view, everything that happens in life is natural –
                sickness/health, satisfaction/disappointment, joy/sadness, even death – and it is only one’s
                interpretation of events which can trouble a person. The logos, which controls all things, controls
                one’s fate as well but, even so, a human being still has the freedom to choose how to respond to
                circumstance.</p>
